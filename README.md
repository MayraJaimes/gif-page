# Giphy App

## Overview

This app populates gifs related to what the user inputs in the search box.

## Description

The theme of this application is sports. A couple of bottons are displayed on the top of the page with the name of a sport. When the user clicks on the button, 10 static gifs related to that sport will get displayed on the page. When the user inputs and submits a new string, a new button is generated showing that string. 

When the user clicks on a gif, the gif animates. Once the user clicks on the gif again, it becomes statis again.

The gifs' ratings are displayed below the gif(PG, G, so on), which is data provided by the GIPHY API.
